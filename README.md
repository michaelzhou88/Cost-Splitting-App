# Cost-Splitting-App
A web application designed to help users split bills and manage shared expenses effortlessly.

The idea for the application came from the common challenge people face when trying to manage shared expenses, such as splitting bills among roommates or friends after a group outing. The goal is to simplify this process by providing a user-friendly platform that can handle various types of expenses and calculate each personâ€™s share automatically.

For the time being, I am primarily using Python, leveraging frameworks such as streamlit for building the web application. One of the core features of the application is the ability to add expenses, assign them to specific users, and then calculate the total amount each person owes. Users can also track their payment history and see outstanding balances.

More features will be added soon!
